    <h1>My favorite hobby
      is reading book</h1>
  <p>Nowadays many peoples are so many intelligent this is because the people read the book.

the 80% knowledge of the person is because of the books,

we should read the most and more books as possible because we get very knowledge from the books.

The knowledge which we get in the books that knowledge cannot get anywhere in the world.

some people are very lazy and therefore They does not read the books they think that they should get the knowledge from anywhere but this is the wrong method because the knowledge which we get in the books that knowledge can't get in the world in anywhere.

we should read the books by our all concentration because if we read one book then we get the maximum knowledge and we can use that knowledge in our maby works.

while reading the books our reading speed also increased and we also know about the sentences, vacublaries, Proverbs.
And by reading the books our concentration power is also Increases.</p>
